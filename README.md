# Simple Female Gender Mod
A simple female gender mod for minecraft forge 1.8.9

## Why?
lots of people use female skins in minecraft however on legacy versions there is not a way for these players to have a female body shape.

## what?
- This mod adds a breast shape to the chest of the player to make the player look more feminine.
- It is not NSFW.
- It is inspired by [WildfireFemaleGenderMod (GitHub)](https://github.com/WildfireRomeo/WildfireFemaleGenderMod) however it is not a 1:1 implimentation of that mod and it's not a port since modern minecraft handles rendering stuff so differently. If you play modern versions defiantly check out their mod.

## Todo
- Port to the OneConfig enviroment before the config mafia find me.
- Try to add animations and customisation.
